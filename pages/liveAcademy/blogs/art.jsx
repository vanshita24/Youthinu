            Everyone is artistic in some form or the other. Art takes many
            forms, from cooking and baking to woodworking, welding, interior
            design, sewing, crafting, etc. We all do something creative in our
            day-to-day lives. Learning to paint is just an extension of that
            creativity and has many perks. While staying fit is vital for your
            health, finding a creative outlet keeps your mind strong while also
            expanding your horizons. Painting provides a fun, new hobby that
            sharpens your mind and delivers various health benefits.

            Entering your little world of creativity and forgetting outside
            stressors would serve as a mini-vacation for your mind. Art is an
            activity highly recommended for children to help brain development
            and improve creativity and problem-solving. Painting can be very
            meditative. Using a brush and paint, you can block out all the noise
            and stress of life and lose yourself in the creative process.
            Pouring your emotions into your painting is the best way to express
            the thoughts and feelings that you have trouble saying out loud.

            There is no doubt that the arts are fun for kids. Diving into those
            finger paints and making a beautiful picture to hang on the fridge
            is indeed exhilarating. The arts don't just stop after developing
            children's creativity; the skills they learn from arts spill over
            into academic achievement. A report says that young people who
            indulge in the arts are four times more likely to be recognized for
            academic achievement than children who do not participate.

             Drawing and painting stimulate both hemispheres of the brain, both
            the left and the right. The left invokes the logical essence, while
            the right side exploits our creativity and emotions. The practice of
            drawing and painting are procedures that demand a certain amount of
            patience and caution; it teaches us to wait, to listen, and to
            appreciate silence; in short, to have peace, prudence, and respect
            for ourselves and others. People who frequently use creative outlets
            such as writing, painting, and drawing have less chance of
            developing memory loss illnesses as they age. Given all the
            beneficial attributes to this artistic hobby, it is clear that
            painting builds good mental health in individuals of every age.{' '}
