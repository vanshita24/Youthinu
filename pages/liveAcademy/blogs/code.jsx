            Coding, in the simplest of terms, is telling a computer what you
            want it to do. It involves typing in step-by-step commands for the
            computer to follow. Code powers our digital world. Every website,
            smartphone app, computer program, calculator, and even microwave
            relies on code to operate. Thus coders are the architects and
            builders of the digital age. Over the next ten years, there would be
            around 1.4 million jobs in computer sciences. Jobs not directly
            linked to computer science (such as banking, medicine, and
            journalism) will also need a basic understanding of programming and
            coding. Therefore, students who learn coding at a young age will
            have numerous progressive employment opportunities available to them
            in the future.

            Coding helps children to be able to visualize abstract concepts,
            lets them apply math to real-world situations and makes math fun and
            creative. Children who learn to code understand how to plan and
            organize thoughts. Coding is a basic literacy in the digital age,
            and kids need to understand and work with the technology around
            them. Having children learn coding at a young age prepares them for
            the future. Coding helps children with communication, creativity,
            math, writing, and confidence.

            When you know how to think, you open up endless possibilities to
            your work and life. Coding trains your brain to think deeply,
            identify the troubles, break things up, then put the pieces together
            to arrive at a solution. These troubleshooting skills help you
            become smarter personally and professionally and see a situation
            from a new perspective. Some might think coding is boring with
            standard formulas, but it can be fun and creative. There won’t be
            the same problems to be resolved every time; you will overcome
            different challenges that require new solutions. While working on
            coding projects, you can make use of your creativity to provide a
            tailored solution to an issue – and your innovative solution might
            somehow change the world.
