            Experts say that Mathematics is the gate and key of Science. All
            these Sciences such as Physics, Medicine, and Engineering progress
            only with the aid of Mathematics. So it is aptly remarked,
            “Mathematics is a Science of all Sciences and art of all arts.” It
            is much more than Arithmetic, more than Algebra more than Geometry.
            Also, it is much more than Trigonometry, Statistics, and Calculus.
            Primarily mathematics is a way of thinking and organizing logical
            proofs. Mathematics intimately connects with everyday life and is
            necessary to the successful conduct of affairs. We use math every
            day. For example, we use math when crossing the road, cooking,
            telling the time, and many more.

            Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Certain
            qualities nurtured by mathematics are the power of reasoning,
            creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical thinking,
            problem-solving ability, and even efficient communication skills.

            Mathematics is the cradle of all creations, without which the world
            cannot move an inch. Everyone needs mathematics in their day-to-day
            life, be it a cook or a farmer, a carpenter or a mechanic, a
            shopkeeper or a doctor, an engineer or a scientist, a musician or a
            magician. Even insects use mathematics in their everyday life for
            existence. Snails make their shells, spiders design their webs, and
            bees build hexagonal combs. There are countless examples of
            mathematical patterns in nature’s fabric.{' '}

              To live in a mathematically-driven world and not know math is like
              walking through an art museum with your eyes closed.

            Anyone can be a mathematician if one is given proper guidance and
            training in the formative period of one’s life. A good curriculum of
            mathematics is helpful in effective teaching and learning of the
            subject. Experience says it is possible to learn mathematics more
            easily and enjoyably if our curriculum includes mathematical
            activities and games. Math puzzles and riddles encourage and attract
            an alert and open-minded attitude among youngsters and help them
            develop clarity in their thinking.{' '}

            Mathematical concepts should be taught clearly to a child, right
            from their primary classes. The process of learning is complete if
            our sense of hearing accompanies our sense of sight. YouthInU
            Academy brings forward a collection of comprehensive mathematics
            courses for students from KG till Class 12. Learn Math with us
            through puzzles, riddles, illustrations, sketches, models, and
            whatnot. Let us realize and appreciate the beauty of the subject and
            embrace it with all our hearts. It is a talent to be compulsorily
            honed by all in every walk of life.
